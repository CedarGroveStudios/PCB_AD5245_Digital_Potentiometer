The AD5245 Digital Potentiometer breakout board is a simple implementation of the Analog Devices' I2C, 10K-ohm chip. The potentiometer sports 256 resistance steps and can work with a power source from 2.7v to 5.5v. The pins act similarly to a passive resistive potentiometer, but require that voltages placed on any of the three pins not exceed the power supply voltage or drop below ground potential.

A CircuitPython library is available in the code folder.
